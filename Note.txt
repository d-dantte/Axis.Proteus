1. Since Axis.Proteus.IoC by default stacks registrations of services or implementations, Simple Injector will only utilize
   Container.Collections.Register, and Container.Collections.AppendRegistration.
   ps: 'stacking' registrations means i can register 'IService1' to multiple implementations, and also have the same implementation registered
   to multiple services. All of which can be achieved by repeatedly calling the 'Register' method with the appropriate parameter.
2. Following #1 above, resolving types will always use Container.GetAllInstances as the base, and filter out instances from what is returned.
